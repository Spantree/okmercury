# OKMercury

A blatant plagiarism of the [OKCupid Matching Algorithm](http://www.okcupid.com/help/match-percentages) applied to 
business matchmaking at meetings and conferences.

If you're more visual, check out this [TED Talk](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/inside-okcupid-the-math-of-online-dating-christian-rudder) describing the algorithm, which was released on
Valentines Day 2013.

Part of a [48-hour hackathon](http://mpitechcon.com/hackathon/).  This project may never be complete.
